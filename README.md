<h1> Managing Water Cut Impact on Oil Well Perfomance </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In the oil and gas industry, "water cut" refers to the proportion of water present in a mixture of crude oil and water produced from an oil well. It's a crucial parameter used to assess the overall quality of the produced fluid and to determine the appropriate processing and treatment required before the oil can be refined or sold.

<h2>Methodology </h2>
An oil well has been drilled in OPPORTUNE field and PVT laboratory test has been performed for this well The fluid PVT data is as follows:

<h2>Steps</h2>
A vertical completion well is designed. The IPR model is chosen as WELL PI with static pressure of 4000, temperature as 175oF, assumed wellhead pressure of 900psi and input liquid PI of 8STB/d/psi.
The following well configuration data were used to construct vertical lift. The model was then run to find the oil production rate with the node selected to be at the perforations to separate the inflow performance (reservoir behavior) from the outflow behavior of the tubing.

<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
The figure above shows a graph of Pressure at nodal analysis point (psi) against tock-tank liquid at nodal point (STB/d) for the various water cut of 0%-60%. The intersection of the outflow curve and the inflow curve for the watercut value of 0% to 50% indicates that there is continuity in the system and the well will be expected to produce. However, the rate of oil production decreases as the watercut increases from 0% to 50% as seen in Table 5 and the pressure at the nodal analysis point increases in the same direction (i.e. 0%-50%). At 60% watercut, the outflow curve and the inflow curve do not intersect indicating no continuity in the system and the well will not produce.

Nevertheless, from the above fgure, it is seen that if the reservoir pressure could be increased to about 5000 psi, the outflow curve would intersect with the inflow performance curve thus, the well will produce even at 60% watercut.

The oil production rate for the various WOR at 13002 ft and 13200 ft is given in  two Tables below respectively.

<br />

After, the depth of perforation or well completion was also varied to see if it could affect water breakthrough and consequently affect the oil production rate.

<br />
<br />
  
From the figure above, it is observed that as the completion depth was increased from 13002 ft to 13200 ft, with the same percentage of water cut (i.e., from 0% to 60%), the oil production rate decreased for the same water cut value of 0% to 40% as seen from Table 5 and 6. For 50% and 60% water cut at 13200 ft, the inflow performance curve and the outflow performance curve do not intersect thus, no oil production will be expected.

<h2>Key Takeaways: </h2>
Effective management and control of water cut in oil and gas production is essential for maximizing hydrocarbon recovery, minimizing operating costs, and optimizing production efficiency. This involves a comprehensive approach encompassing reservoir, wellbore, and fluid handling strategies. Key tactics include selective completions and downhole equipment deployment to target hydrocarbon-bearing zones, efficient fluid handling and separation using separators and treatment facilities, continuous surveillance and monitoring to detect water breakthrough, reservoir pressure maintenance through secondary recovery methods, well interventions and workovers to restore well integrity, and utilization of reservoir engineering techniques such as enhanced oil recovery and water shut-off treatments. By implementing these strategies, operators can mitigate water production, enhance hydrocarbon yields, and ensure the economic viability of oil and gas production operations
